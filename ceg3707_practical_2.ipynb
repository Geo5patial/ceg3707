    "This practical aims to guide you through the interpretation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for deformation monitoring. Two examples are introduced: (i) coseismic surface displacement for a moderate-sized earthquake and (ii) surface displacement associate with a volcanic magma inflation. You will use InSAR observations to discuss the hazard implications of the area in which the events occurred.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 24th March 2011, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Shan state in East Myanmar. The earthquake caused nearly 70 fatalities and hundreds of injuries and large infrastructure damages following many landslides. The earthquake generated intense ground shaking and was felt many kilometres away from the epicentre. Fortunately, the ALOS-1 mission was operational. ALOS-1 was operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and collected L‚Äêband InSAR observations. The two figures below correspond to the derived coseismic interferograms in different looking directions.\n",

    "<img src=\"./img/burma2011_descending_anotate.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "### What does the interferogram tell us about the earthquake?\n",
    "\n",
    "The interferograms (Figures 1 and 2) represents a map of the displacement of the ground surface during the earthquake. The pattern of interference fringes can be interpreted as a series of contours of equal surface displacement. When interpreting such a pattern it is important to know the sign convention used in plotting the interferogram. In this case, each successive cycle of colours from blue to green to yellow indicates an increase in the distance between the ground and the satellite. If we assume that the \"far-field\" of the interferogram was not displaced in the earthquake, then we can estimate the amount of displacement in the earthquake by starting in the far-field (the zero displacement line) and counting the fringes inwards.\n",
    "Such data can be used to give additional information about the earthquake that could not be determined by seismology or field investigation alone, such as the amounts and relative proportions of uplift and subsidence caused by the event over an area tens of kilometres wide. In combination with the digital elevation model of the same area, we can also examine the relationship between earthquakes and surface topography.\n",

    "<img style=\"padding: 7px\" src=\"./img/OkmokdefoGPS.jpg\" width=\"700\" align=\"right\" /> Okmok is one of the more active volcanoes in Alaska‚Äôs Aleutian Chain. Its last (confirmed) eruption was in the summer of 2008. Okmok is interesting from an InSAR perspective as it inflates and deflates heavily as magma moves around in its magmatic source located roughly 2.5 km underneath the surface. To learn more about Okmok volcano and its eruptive history, please visit the very informative site of the <a href=\"https://avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/activity.php?volcname=Okmok&eruptionid=604&page=basic\" target=\"_blank\">Alaska Volcano Observatory</a>.\n",

The figure to the right shows the Okmok surface displacement as measured by GPS data from field campaigns conducted in 2000 and 2002. The plots show that the displacement measured at the site is consistent with that created by an inflating point (Mogi) source.\n",
